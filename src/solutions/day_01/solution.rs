/// ## Example input

/// 3   4
/// 4   3
/// 2   5
/// 1   3
/// 3   9
/// 3   3
/// ```
/// Pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are.
/// Pair up the *smallest number in the left list*  with the *smallest number in
/// the right list*, then the *second-smallest left number* with the *second-
/// smallest right number*, and so on.
/// 
/// With each pair, figure out *how far apart* the two numnbers are; you'll need
/// to *add up all of those distances.* For example, if you pair up a `3` from
/// the left list with a `7` from the right list, the distance apart is `4`;
/// if you pair up a `9` with a `3`, the distance apart is `6`.
